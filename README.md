# AI-Chatbot-Developer-RAG-Zendesk-Shopify-Integration
We are looking for an experienced AI developer to build and integrate an AI-powered chatbot for our Shopify website. The chatbot will use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer customer inquiries, improve over time, and integrate with Zendesk for support ticket generation and escalation.

The AI must be trained on thousands of customer support tickets from Zendesk, extracted and cleaned by the developer. It should handle both prospective customers' questions (e.g., “Do you make a holster for a Staccato C2?”) and existing customer support issues (e.g., “My holster was made wrong. How do I return it?”).

This will be an ongoing project requiring continuous improvements and maintenance after deployment.

Responsibilities:
Data Extraction & Training:

Extract and clean historical support ticket data from Zendesk.
Build a knowledge base for RAG-based AI responses.
Train the AI chatbot to recognize and respond accurately.
Ensure the AI improves over time with new interactions.
AI Development & Integration:

Develop an AI chatbot (model choice open to expert recommendation) using RAG.
Integrate the chatbot into our Shopify website.
Ensure the chatbot pulls real-time data on product inventory, order status, etc.
Connect the chatbot to Zendesk for ticket creation and escalation.
Functionality & Features:

Provide direct responses and escalate complex issues to human agents.
Recognize customer order history based on email input.
Support multi-channel integration via Zendesk (e.g., email, live chat).
Restrict AI from storing or sharing sensitive customer data.
Ongoing Maintenance & Optimization:

Continuously improve AI accuracy based on new customer interactions.
Maintain and update the knowledge base.
Provide ongoing technical support and troubleshooting.
Requirements:
✅ Proven experience in AI chatbot development (preferably using RAG).

        Build the chatbot using a suitable AI model.
        Integrate the chatbot with Shopify, Zendesk, and real-time data sources.
        Ensure chatbot features like order history retrieval, inventory updates, and ticket escalation.

    Ongoing Maintenance & Optimization:
        Continuously optimize the AI model based on new interactions.
        Provide regular maintenance for accuracy and model improvements.

Python Code Example:

Below is a high-level Python code example to start building and integrating the chatbot with Zendesk, Shopify, and RAG:
1. Setting Up the Libraries:

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:

pip install openai
pip install requests
pip install pandas
pip install zendesk

2. Zendesk Integration (Data Extraction):

You can use Zendesk API to extract historical support ticket data.

import requests

# Zendesk API credentials
zendesk_url = 'https://your_subdomain.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets.json'
zendesk_api_user = 'your_email/token'
zendesk_api_token = 'your_zendesk_api_token'

# Fetch Zendesk tickets
def fetch_zendesk_tickets():
    response = requests.get(
        zendesk_url,
        auth=(zendesk_api_user, zendesk_api_token)
    )
    if response.status_code == 200:
        tickets = response.json()['tickets']
        return tickets
    else:
        print(f"Error fetching tickets: {response.status_code}")
        return []

# Clean and process Zendesk data (basic example)
def clean_ticket_data(tickets):
    cleaned_data = []
    for ticket in tickets:
        cleaned_data.append({
            'ticket_id': ticket['id'],
            'subject': ticket['subject'],
            'description': ticket['description'],
            'status': ticket['status'],
            'created_at': ticket['created_at'],
        })
    return cleaned_data

tickets = fetch_zendesk_tickets()
cleaned_tickets = clean_ticket_data(tickets)
print(cleaned_tickets)

3. RAG-based AI Model Development:

Here, we’ll use OpenAI for RAG-based AI to generate responses based on the extracted Zendesk data and product information. We’ll also need to incorporate a retrieval system for product-related questions.

import openai

# OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'

# Function to get RAG response from OpenAI
def get_rag_response(query, context_data):
    prompt = f"Context: {context_data}\n\nQuestion: {query}\nAnswer:"
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example context from Zendesk tickets
context_data = "Customer issue: 'My holster was made wrong. How do I return it?'"

# Customer's question
customer_question = "How do I return my holster?"

# Get response based on RAG model
response = get_rag_response(customer_question, context_data)
print(response)

4. Shopify Integration (Order History):

To integrate Shopify and get customer order history, you can use Shopify's API.

import requests

# Shopify API credentials
shopify_url = 'https://your-shop.myshopify.com/admin/api/2023-03/orders.json'
shopify_api_key = 'your_shopify_api_key'
shopify_password = 'your_shopify_password'

# Function to fetch customer order history
def fetch_shopify_order_history(customer_email):
    response = requests.get(
        shopify_url,
        auth=(shopify_api_key, shopify_password),
        params={'email': customer_email}
    )
    if response.status_code == 200:
        orders = response.json()['orders']
        return orders
    else:
        print(f"Error fetching orders: {response.status_code}")
        return []

# Example customer email
customer_email = "customer@example.com"
orders = fetch_shopify_order_history(customer_email)
print(orders)

5. Zendesk Ticket Creation (Escalation):

When a question cannot be answered by the chatbot, it should create a Zendesk ticket.

def create_zendesk_ticket(subject, description):
    ticket_data = {
        'ticket': {
            'subject': subject,
            'description': description,
            'priority': 'normal'
        }
    }
    response = requests.post(
        zendesk_url,
        auth=(zendesk_api_user, zendesk_api_token),
        json=ticket_data
    )
    if response.status_code == 201:
        print("Ticket created successfully.")
    else:
        print(f"Error creating ticket: {response.status_code}")

6. Integrating Everything (Chatbot Endpoint):

We can integrate these pieces into a web service that handles customer queries and creates tickets when needed. You might want to use Flask for this.

pip install Flask

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/chatbot', methods=['POST'])
def chatbot():
    user_input = request.json.get('user_input')
    customer_email = request.json.get('customer_email')

    # Fetch order history if needed
    orders = fetch_shopify_order_history(customer_email)

    # Check if AI can answer (use RAG or fallback)
    context_data = "Context from Zendesk tickets and Shopify orders"
    response = get_rag_response(user_input, context_data)
    
    # If the answer is insufficient, escalate to Zendesk
    if "I don't know" in response:
        create_zendesk_ticket("Customer query", user_input)
        return jsonify({"response": "Your issue has been escalated to support."})
    
    return jsonify({"response": response})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Features and Enhancements:

    Real-time Data Integration:
        The chatbot must query live Shopify data (orders, product availability).
        It should also check for updates from Zendesk tickets for any new customer issues.

    Secure Data Handling:
        Ensure that no sensitive data (like full credit card info or personal details) is stored unnecessarily.
        Follow data privacy standards (GDPR, etc.).

    Continuous Learning:
        As the chatbot interacts with customers, the model should improve by incorporating new interactions.
        Periodic retraining using Zendesk data to adapt to new customer issues.

    Multi-channel Support:
        Integrate with Zendesk’s multi-channel system to handle interactions via email, live chat, and other platforms.
        Implement different response formats depending on the medium (email, chat, etc.).

Conclusion:

This Python code provides the foundational structure for a chatbot built using RAG-based AI and integrated with Shopify and Zendesk. The next steps would involve further refining the data extraction, implementing the chatbot interface on Shopify, and ensuring secure data handling and continuous improvements.
